## Introduction
When brainstorming project ideas, it came apparent that I wanted to work on something that I was heavily interested in. I decided I wanted to combine my interests of neural networks with the sport of golf.

I was curious to see if I could accurately predict the golf scores for the annual PGA Masters Tournament, using deep learning techniques. This project would not be hosted or deployed anywhere. Instead, it would be able to be run locally on ones computer. 

The goal of this project was to try to predict golf scores, while also further gaining knowledge in the deep learning/machine learning space.
## Selection of Data.
The first step in this project was to get data. Because of time constraints, I decided to use this web scraper I found on github, that scrapes the data of the offical PGA website using R. [https://github.com/jdubbert/Scrape-World-Golf-Rankings](https://github.com/jdubbert/Predicting-2019-Masters/blob/master/PGA_Scrape_Data.Rmd)

This CSV file can be found here


Fortunately, this data did not need that much munging and cleaning, besides some formating issues with 5 different columns.

Data preview:
This data has 42 different features, and has 1003 samples.
