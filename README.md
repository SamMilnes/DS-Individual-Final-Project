## Introduction
When brainstorming project ideas, it came apparent that I wanted to work on something that I was heavily interested in. I decided I wanted to combine my interests of neural networks with the sport of golf.

I was curious to see if I could accurately predict the golf scores for the annual PGA Masters Tournament, using deep learning techniques. This project would not be hosted or deployed anywhere. 

The goal of this project was to try to predict golf scores, while also further gaining knowledge in the deep learning/machine learning space.
